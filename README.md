This code relies a gpg encrypted file containing a Cloudflare API token with edit rights to your domain to exist at the location `/home/ip_updater/.ip_updater_auth.gpg`. This is the home directory of a user called `ip_updater`. If there are any questions, please drop me an e-mail at cristian.capsuna@gmail.com

For this code to run you must have installed `libssl-dev`. On Debian this can be done by simply running `sudo apt install libssl-dev`
